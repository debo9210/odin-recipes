    <h3>Smashed Cucumber Salad</h3>
    <p>This smashed cucumber salad is one of my all-time favorite cold summer side dishes. By crushing our cucumber before we cut it, we produce flavors that un-smashed cukes can't. When you crush the cells in a vegetable, as opposed to cutting cleanly through them, certain compounds get mixed together, which can result in a significantly different flavor. In cucumbers, this is a good thing — onions, not so much. The only decision you're going to have to make is how long to let the cucumbers marinate — half an hour or so or not at all.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 English cucumbers</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>red pepper flakes to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap each cucumber in plastic wrap to minimize splattering. Place on a work surface and pound with a flat object (like a meat pounder) until cucumbers crack and are slightly flattened. Remove from plastic. Cut cucumbers in half; halve each side lengthwise. Slice into 1- to 1 1/2 -inch wide slices. Transfer to a strainer set over a bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cucumber with salt and sugar; mix until well combined. Refrigerate the bowl and strainer for 30 to 60 minutes so cucumber pieces can drain into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Place garlic, seasoned rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl; whisk together thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Transfer drained cucumbers into the bowl with dressing. Toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate for about 30 minutes to allow flavors to mingle.</li>
        <li>Place cucumbers in a serving bowl and sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
